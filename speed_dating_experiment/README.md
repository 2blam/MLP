Model: Deep Learning

Required Python Packages:
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Theano

Two program were provided:
- deep_learning.py
- deep_learning_w_tensorboard.py

For deep_learning_w_tenseorboard.py, this program would show the accuracy and loss during training the DNN.
To show the tensorboard, open a new terminal, issue the following command: 
<code>tensorboard --logdir=&lt;log directory path&gt; --reload_interval=1</code>
